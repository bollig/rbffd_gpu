RBF-FD calculate weights on GPU (solve many small linear systems; each with via one block of threads)

Stokes multi-CPU 
    - New manufactured solution
    - Reordered matrix for one block
    - Multi-GMRES without constraints
    - Multi-ILU


With ViennaCL can I create a vector of type "vcl::vector<double4>" ? would make my stokes life much much easier. 
    -- Could use a sparse permutation matrix to permute the vectors back to proper order.




- FInish Cosine Benchmark main loop (destroy, reconstruct)
- MPI CosineVCL
- Overlapping comm VCL
- GFLOPS (plug-in formula. Assume 1 : 1 ratio on memloads and compute. (1 op for muladd)
