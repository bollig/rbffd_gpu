This directory contains:
	- A collection of subdirs, each with a test for the rbf framework
	- Each test is run independently. See each directory for details on test parameters

Create a New Test from Template
===============================
(from RBF.framework/tests/)
To create a new test, 

1) copy the template test directory to your desired test name (e.g. "mytest"): 

	$> cp -r template mytest

2) Inside ./CMakelists.txt (That is: RBF.framework/tests/CMakeLists.txt), 
   Append the name of the variable TEST_COLLECTION: 

        SET (TEST_COLLECTION
				mytest
                template        # WORKS
        )

  Save the file and exit. 

3) Modify ./mytest/CMakeLists.txt to rename the project: 
   
	< PROJECT (template_name)
	---
	> PROJECT (mytest)

   Save the file and exit.

4) Edit ./mytest/main.cpp to create your test source. Any additional *.cpp files
   int ./mytest must be added to the ADD_EXECUTABLE call in ./mytest/CMakeLists.txt

5) Specify command line arguments to the executable by appending to ARGV in 
   ./mytest/CMakeLists.txt

6) Specify the number of processes to execute with NUM_PROCS in 
   ./mytest/CMakeLists.txt



Multiple Tests for one Executable
==================================
(from RBF.framework/tests/)
To add an additional execution/test of an executable, add additional "ADD_TEST"
lines to the executable subdirectory CMakeLists.txt 
(e.g. RBF.framework/tests/mytest/CMakeLists.txt): 

Parallel Test Format: ADD_TEST( [TestName] [MPIExecutable] [MPINumProcFlag] [#ofProcs] [MPIOptions] [Executable] [Arg1] [Arg2] ... [ArgN])
Serial Test Format: ADD_TEST( [TestName] [Executable] [Arg1] [Arg2] ... [ArgN])
