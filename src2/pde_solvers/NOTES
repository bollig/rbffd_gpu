A solver is configured with: 
	a pde to solve
	a spatial discretization scheme (some type of FD, FEM, FVM scheme)
	a temporal discretization scheme

A discretization scheme like FD would need: 
	a grid of nodes
	stencils
	a weighting scheme for stencil nodes
For RBFFD we specify: 

	grid = new Grid(10,10);
	grid.generateStencils(stencil_size); 
	rbffd = new RBFFDSpatialScheme(grid.stencils); // use RBFs to get weights
	fd = new FDSpatialScheme(grid.stencils); 	 // use standard FD weights 
	rk4 = new RK4TemporalScheme(); 
	rbf_pde_solver = new PDESolver(grid, rbffd, rk4); 
	fd_pde_solver = new PDESolver(grid, fd, rk4);
