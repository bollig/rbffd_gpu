The Vienna Computing Library (\ViennaCL) is a scientific computing
library written in C++. It allows simple, high-level access
to the vast computing resources available on parallel architectures such as
GPUs and multi-core CPUs. The primary focus is on common linear algebra
operations (BLAS level 1
and 2) and the solution of large sparse systems of equations by means of iterative
methods. In {\ViennaCLminorversion}, the following iterative solvers are
implemented (confer for example to the book of Y.~Saad
\cite{saad-iterative-solution}):
\begin{itemize}
 \item Conjugate Gradient (CG)
 \item Stabilized BiConjugate Gradient (BiCGStab)
 \item Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES)
\end{itemize}
An optional ILU preconditioner can be used, which is in {\ViennaCLversion}
precomputed and applied on a single CPU core and may thus not lead to overall
performance gains over a purely CPU based implementation.

The solvers and preconditioners can also be used with different
libraries due to a generic implementation. At present, it is possible to
use the solvers and preconditioner directly with the {\ublas} library from
{\Boost} \cite{boost}.

Under the hood, {\ViennaCL} uses {\OpenCL} \cite{khronoscl} for accessing and
executing code on compute devices. Therefore, {\ViennaCL} is not tailored 
to products from a particular vendor and can be used on many different
platforms. At present, {\ViennaCL} is known to work on modern GPUs from \NVIDIA
and ATI (see Tab.~\ref{tab:double-precision-GPUs}) as well as CPUs from AMD
using the ATI Stream SDK. In principle, the ATI Stream SDK can also be used with
{\ViennaCL} on multi-core CPUs from Intel, even though this is not officially
supported by ATI.

\NOTE{Double precision arithmetic on GPUs is only possible if it is provided by the GPU. There is no double precision emulation in {\ViennaCL}.}

\NOTE{Double precision arithmetic using the ATI Stream SDK is only
exerimental. See Sec.~\ref{sec:opencl-on-ati} for details.}

\caption{Available arithmetics in {\ViennaCL} provided by selected GPUs. At the
release of {\ViennaCLversion}, GPUs from ATI do not comply to {\OpenCL}
standard for double precision extensions and can thus only be used in single
precision arithmetics in {\ViennaCL} per default. Once the driver of these GPUs
complies to the double precision extension standard of {\OpenCL}, they can be
used with {\ViennaCL} immediately. An experimental support for ATI GPUs has to
be enabled explicitly in {\ViennaCL}, see Sec.~\ref{sec:opencl-on-ati}.}
