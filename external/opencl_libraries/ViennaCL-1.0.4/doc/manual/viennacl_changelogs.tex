\section*{Version 1.0.x}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.4} 
The changes in this release are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item All tutorials now work out-of the box with Visual Studio 2008.
 \item Eliminated all {\ViennaCL} related warnings when compiling with Visual Studio 2008.
 \item Better (experimental) support for double precision on ATI GPUs, but no \texttt{norm\_1}, \texttt{norm\_2}, \texttt{norm\_inf} and \texttt{index\_norm\_inf} functions using ATI Stream SDK on GPUs in double precision.
 \item Fixed a bug in GMRES that caused segmentation faults under Windows.
 \item Fixed a bug in \texttt{const\_sparse\_matrix\_adapter} (thanks to Abhinav Golas and Nico Galoppo for almost simultaneous emails on that)
 \item Corrected incorrect return values in the sparse matrix regression test suite (thanks to Klaus Schnass for the hint)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.3} 
The main improvements in this release are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Support for multi-core CPUs with ATI Stream SDK (thanks to Riccardo Rossi, UPC. BARCELONA TECH, for suggesting this)
 \item \lstinline|inner_prod| is now up to a factor of four faster (thanks to Serban Georgescu, ETH, for pointing the poor performance of the old implementation out)
 \item Fixed a bug with \lstinline|plane_rotation| that caused system freezes with ATI GPUs.
 \item Extended the doxygen generated reference documentation 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.2} 
A bug-fix release that resolves some problems with the Visual C++ compiler.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fixed some compilation problems under Visual C++ (version 2005 und 2008).
 \item All tutorials accidentally relied on {\ublas}. Now \texttt{tut1} and \texttt{tut5} can be compiled without {\ublas}
 \item Renamed \texttt{aux/} folder to \texttt{auxiliary/} (caused some problems on windows machines)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.1} 
This is a quite large revision of \texttt{ViennaCL 1.0.0}, but mainly improves things under the hood.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fixed a bug in lu\_substitute for dense matrices
 \item Changed iterative solver behavior to stop if a certain relative residual is reached
 \item ILU preconditioning is now fully done on the CPU, because this gives best overall performance
 \item All OpenCL handles of {\ViennaCL} types can now be accessed via member function \texttt{handle()}
 \item Improved GPU performance of GMRES by about a factor of two.
 \item Added generic \texttt{norm\_2} function in header file \texttt{norm\_2.hpp}
 \item Wrapper for \texttt{clFlush()} and \texttt{clFinish()} added
 \item Device information can be queried by \texttt{device.info()}
 \item Extended documentation and tutorials
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.0}
