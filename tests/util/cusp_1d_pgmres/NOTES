This test
    - construct a 1d line of points
    - decompose points into p-partitions (on independent processors)
    - assemble a sub DM for -lapl(u) = f on each processor
    - assume dirichlet boundary conditions
    - solve system using parallel GMRES and ViennaCL


TODO: 
    - avoid loading grid and generating stencils on one processor (need a parallel tree structure) 
    - use a preprocessor like parmetis to generate partitions rather that write my own software for previous point
    -
