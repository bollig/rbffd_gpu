Decide whether you are a regular user or developer. Choose a set of build instructions below
based on your decision. 

[For Regular Users] 
To make an in-source build:

1) check out the RBF.framework from SVN
2) Start build: 
	cd RBF.framework
	cmake .
	make  

[For Developers] 
I usually make an out-of-source build so the CMake temp and build files do not muck with the source tree

1) check out the RBF.framework from SVN 
2) make the out of core build directory (OUTSIDE of RBF.framework):
	mkdir <BUILD_DIR>				(e.g. mkdir rbf-build) 
	cd <BUILD_DIR>					(e.g. cd rbf-build) 
	cmake <PATH_TO_RBF.FRAMEWORK>	(e.g. cmake ../RBF.framework)
	make 


[For Users and Developers]

Existing make targets: 

make 						// Build library and tests
make test					// Run ALL tests (use command "ctest" for SUBSET)
make doc					// Run doxygen
make package-source			// Build a source tarball for distribution


Required software: 

Armadillo v0.8.2 			(http://arma.sourceforge.net)
FFTW 3.2.2 
OpenMPI  				(Installed by default on OSX10.6)


Additional Notes: 
===============
1) To change the path for gordon_tests (i.e. the parent directory for the required utilities library),
   modify RBF.framework/CMakeLists.txt

	   Line 5:
		SET(GLIB ~/gordon_tests)

   CMake will search ${GLIB}/utilities to find libutilities.a

2) To test a SUBSET of the tests in RBF.framework/tests you cannot use "make test".
   Instead, call CTest directly (from BUILD_DIR or whatever directory you ran "make" in): 

	$> ctest -R <regex> 
   
   where <regex> is a regular expression matched against all test names; only matches will 
   be executed. For example (given tests "template", "mytest", "my_template_copy"): 

	$> ctest -R temp

   will execute tests: "template" and "my_template_copy"
   but not: "mytest"


3) The tests subdirectory has a few tests setup to run using MPI_EXEC. Output by default goes to 

   	build/Testing/LastTest.log

   To manually execute (from directory: BUILD_DIR):

	cd tests/<testname>
	make && mpiexec -np [#ofProcs] ./<testname> [options]

   where the [options] are intended for the test executable. To get a list of available option
   execute: 
	./<testname> --help 

4) For instructions on creating tests see RBF.framework/tests/README



OS Specific Notes: 
==================
Linux
	libarmadillo0 provided by Ubuntu 9.10 is outdated and INSUFFICIENT. 
	Download Armadillo 0.8.2 from http://arma.sourceforge.net and install manually

OSX
	OpenMPI is installed by default on Snow Leopard (OSX 10.6)


Windows
    armadillo must be installed before building this library (install to ~/local)
    #openmpi must be installed before building this library (install to ~/local)
    install mpich2 using Windows Installer (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/downloads/index.php?s=downloads)
        (passphrase: vislab)
