====================== 

- Petsc RBF-FD 
    - Should leverage the parallel solvers and preconditioners
    - May need to modify communication

- Review multi-Coloring and block-ILU
    - Coloring nodes to split matrix into blocks that can be easily updated in parallel
    - Apply ILU to small blocks; how to handle block connectors?
