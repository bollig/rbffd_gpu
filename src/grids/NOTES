note: original_grid.cpp is the original Grid class provided in Gordons code. I am tired of fighting it so I have a simplified Grid interface which i am switching to. I renamed the class to distinguish its use in cases like original_heat and so its obvious which tests I need to concentrate on updating.

Set Q : all nodes in subdomain
set SQ : Q + all stencil nodes
set R = SQ \ Q : nodes not in Q, but required in the stencils of Q

   Dx = Q * (vQ, vR)^T

Decompose dX = (Q R) (vQ, vR)^T


   Deriv(fQ) = (Q, R) (vQ, vR)^T

So create an additional R_rows array to give me the first element of R in each row. 
This is in addition to xadj_row[nb_rows].
