The Vienna Computing Library (\ViennaCL) is a scientific computing
library written in C++. It allows simple, high-level access
to the vast computing resources available on parallel architectures such as
GPUs and multi-core CPUs by using {\OpenCL}. The primary focus is on common linear algebra
operations (BLAS levels 1, 2 and 3) and the solution of large sparse systems of equations by means of iterative
methods. In {\ViennaCLminorversion}, the following iterative solvers are
implemented (confer for example to the book of Y.~Saad \cite{saad-iterative-solution}):
\begin{itemize}
 \item Conjugate Gradient (CG)
 \item Stabilized BiConjugate Gradient (BiCGStab)
 \item Generalized Minimum Residual (GMRES)
\end{itemize}
An optional ILU preconditioner can be used, which is in {\ViennaCLversion}
precomputed and applied on a single CPU core and may thus not lead to overall
performance gains over a purely CPU based implementation.
Moreover, a Jacobi and a row-scaling preconditioner are available, which can be executed directly in parallel on the {\OpenCL} device.

The solvers and preconditioners can also be used with different
libraries due to their generic implementation. At present, it is possible to
use the solvers and preconditioners directly with types from the {\ublas} library, which is part of 
{\Boost} \cite{boost}. The iterative solvers can directly be used with Eigen \cite{eigen} and MTL 4 \cite{mtl4}.

Under the hood, {\ViennaCL} uses {\OpenCL} \cite{khronoscl} for accessing and
executing code on compute devices. Therefore, {\ViennaCL} is not tailored 
to products from a particular vendor and can be used on many different
platforms. At present, {\ViennaCL} is known to work on modern GPUs from {NVIDIA}
and AMD (see Tab.~\ref{tab:double-precision-GPUs}) as well as on CPUs 
using either the AMD Accelerated Parallel Processing SDK (formerly ATI Stream SDK) or the Intel OpenCL SDK.

\NOTE{Double precision arithmetic on GPUs is only possible if it is provided by the GPU. There is no double precision emulation in {\ViennaCL}.}

\NOTE{Double precision arithmetic using the ATI Stream SDK or AMD APP SDK is not yet fully
OpenCL-certified. See Sec.~\ref{sec:opencl-on-ati} for details.}

release of {\ViennaCLversion}, the Stream SDK from AMD/ATI does not comply to
the {\OpenCL} standard for double precision extensions, but we have not observed
problems with the latest version of Stream SDK. Support for AMD devices is now
per default enabled in {\ViennaCL}, see Sec.~\ref{sec:opencl-on-ati}.}
