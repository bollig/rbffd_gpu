Why is constructor 7 sec? Way too long!  Must figure this out. Related to SuperBuffers? 

Getting HW errors. Do not know why. Something to do with Superbuffers?

ERROR Fixed. I did not allocate enough memory to derivative arrays.  Was off by a factor of 4. 

Next step: check results against CPU. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1) use Empty stencils. Derivative should be function itself. Check GPU against CPU.
2) use non-Empty stencils. Derivative should be function itself. Check GPU against CPU.
  Make sure random numbers are identical between CPU and GPU. For that get the stencils from der_pcu and 
  put to der_pgpu, or vide versa.

Derivatives incorrect, buy derivatives of four functions are identical.  Good sign. 

Derivatives should be in the order (u_x,v_x,w_z,p_z)_1,   (u_x,v_x,w_z,p_z)_2, ...

I did not calculate CPU derivatives of all four functions in this test case. MY ERROR. DO THIS.
