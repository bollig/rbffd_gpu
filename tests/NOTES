P1 = priority 1
=================
	ncar_poisson1_nonuniform_diffusivity	--> update to show nonuniform diffusion works. Improve norms and error checking. Convergence Test. 
	original_heat				--> change grid to original_grid. 
	ncar_poisson1_regular_grid		--> Get ncar_poisson1 working on a regular grid instead of an annulus. 
	
P2 = priority 2
===============
	ncar_poisson1 			--> fix so we solve same problem as nonuniform_ncar_poisson1 on the CPU
	ncar_poisson2			--> ditto
	regular_square2D_heat		--> update to use grid_interface
	regulargrid3D_heat		--> get 

P3
===============
update cmakelists.txt in 
	util/*
