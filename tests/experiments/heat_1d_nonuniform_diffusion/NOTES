This test case is the same as heat_1d_verification but add non-uniform diffusion

IT IS NOT COMPLETE: the exact solution is not verified to be a true non-uniform diffusion solution. However, the eyeball norm tells us our routines are calculating non-uniform diffusion correctly even if we dont have a good exact solution to match for error reporting purposes.

Haberman2004 is really helpful. 


Dirichlet Heat 1D: 
p47: product solutions of the eqn are 

u(x,t) = Sum_n=1^inf B sin( (n*pi*x)/L ) * exp( - k * (n * pi/L)^2 * t)

B = (2/L) Int_0^L f(x) sin( (n*pi*x)/L ) dx

where f(x) is the initial condition and n. Any initial condition. 

To get the coeffs we need to do the actual integration. But if we choose our initial condition properly, we might be able to bypass that headache: 

let f(x) = sin(pi x / L) then 
B = 2/L * L/2 = 1
since the integral of sin(pi x / L) * sin ( n pi x/L ) is L/2 when n = 1 and 0 everywhere else. How? sin(pi x/L) * sin(pi x/L ) = sin^2(pi x/L) = [1- cos(2 pi x/L) / 2]. Integrate the new cosine and we get L/2 

If we want to target n = 3 we use the same trick of orthogonality to isolate the n=3 sin wave in the infinite series. This gives us: 

Question: How do we find B when the diffusion is non-uniform? How do we find it when initial conditions do NOT satisfy the form of u(x,t) above?
