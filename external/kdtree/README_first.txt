This code was obtained from the Matlab Central FileExchange
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21512

The class defined in KDTree.h is used by the CVT code in
RBF.Framework

The original makefile has been moved to Makefile_original
while a CMakeLists.txt was added to allow the use of the header
without MEX compilation.
