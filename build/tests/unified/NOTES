- evaluate derivs computes SpMV
	- DONE: add collective (Reduce) for norms
		- mention in the thesis that a Reduce is preferred (2ms for N=27556; 8procs) over Allreduce (30ms for N=27556; 8procs) on Itasca	
	- DONE: iterate
	- TODO: Overlap comm



So this computes 100x the X, Y, Z, L derivs of md N=27556 and n=101 (the worst
case). The time for weights (armadillo with MKL) is hottest. But it happens
once. And the number of iterations required to amortize the cost of
preprocessing: 1000 iterations which is an easy requirement to meet. (remember we have four derivs here).
