******************************************
* Naming convention for kernel functions *
******************************************

The generic location of the raw .cl files in auxiliary-folder is is:
[type]/align[alignment]/[kernelname].cl

where 
[type]       ... the ViennaCL class the kernel is defined for
[alignment]  ... Alignment of data for vectorization (1,2,4,8,16,...)
[kernelname] ... name of the kernel

Note that kernels for double precision are generated automatically by a string replace of "float" -> "double"

The converter program generates the static strings in viennacl/linalg/kernels/ from the cl-files in the header files

Use the convert.sh script to inject all kernels into the ViennaCL source tree!
