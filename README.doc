The doc directory has been removed and placed in a separate GIT repository.

Most of the documentaton is latex and PNG figures, so we avoid distributing it
with the source code to keep the dist size small.

To get the content of the doc directory you can either: 

a) from this directory run "git submodule init; git submodule update" which will connect to the doc git repo and fetch a specific version of the documentation that was current the day the dir was removed from this repo.  NOTE: if you want the latest documentation, run the above command, followed by "cd doc; git checkout master; git pull origin master"

b) checkout the doc repo independently of the rbffd_gpu.git. The git url is: ssh://pamd.sc.fsu.edu/~efb06/repos/rbffd_gpu_doc.git
