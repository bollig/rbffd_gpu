Screwed up tests with derivative multi, and multi_weights. Fix tomorrow. 

Create data files for the following cases: 

10 nodes per stencil
32 nodes per stencil
33 nodes per stencil
64 nodes per stencil

Compact versus random stencils
(6 cases)

(nb elements)
16*16*16 = 4096 nodes (40960,131k,135k,262k)
32*32*32 = 2^(15) = 32,768 (328k,1.05M,1.08M,2.1M)
64*64*64 = 2^(18) = 262,144 (2.6M,8.4M,8.6M,16.8M)
128*128*128 = 2,097,152 (20.9M,67M,69M,134M)
100*100*100 = 1000000 nodes (1.e6)

Largest array in double: 134M*8 = 1.07Gbytes 
  (The MIC has 32 Gbytes of memory, so it is possible.)
