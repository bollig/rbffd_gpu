\section*{Version 1.1.x}

\subsection*{Version 1.1.2}
This final release of the {\ViennaCL} 1.1.x family focuses on refurbishing existing functionality:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fixed a bug with partial vector copies from CPU to GPU (thanks to sourceforge.net user kaiwen).
 \item Corrected error estimations in CG and BiCGStab iterative solvers (thanks to Riccardo Rossi for the hint).
 \item Improved performance of CG and BiCGStab as well as Jacobi and row-scaling preconditioners considerably (thanks to Farshid Mossaiby and Riccardo Rossi for a lot of input).
 \item Corrected linker statements in CMakeLists.txt for MacOS (thanks to Eric Christiansen).
 \item Improved handling of {\ViennaCL} types (direct construction, output streaming of matrix- and vector-expressions, etc.).
 \item Updated old code in the \texttt{coordinate\_matrix} type and improved performance (thanks to Dongdong Li for finding this).
 \item Using \lstinline|size_t| instead of \lstinline|unsigned int| for the size type on the host.
 \item Updated double precision support detection for AMD hardware.
 \item Fixed a name clash in direct\_solve.hpp and ilu.hpp (thanks to sourceforge.net user random).
 \item Prevented unsupported assignments and copies of sparse matrix types (thanks to sourceforge.net user kszyh).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.1.1}
This new revision release has a focus on better interaction with other linear algebra libraries. The few known glitches with version 1.1.0 are now removed.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fixed compilation problems on MacOS X and {\OpenCL} 1.0 header files due to undefined an preprocessor constant (thanks to Vlad-Andrei Lazar and Evan Bollig for reporting this)
 \item Removed the accidental external linkage for three functions (we appreciate the report by Gordon Stevenson).
 \item New out-of-the-box support for {\Eigen} \cite{eigen} and {\MTL} \cite{mtl4} libraries. Iterative solvers from ViennaCL can now directly be used with both libraries.
 \item Fixed a problem with GMRES when system matrix is smaller than the maximum Krylov space dimension.
 \item Better default parameter for BLAS3 routines leads to higher performance for matrix-matrix-products.
 \item Added benchmark for dense matrix-matrix products (BLAS3 routines).
 \item Added viennacl-info example that displays infos about the {\OpenCL} backend used by {\ViennaCL}.
 \item Cleaned up CMakeLists.txt in order to selectively enable builds that rely on external libraries.
 \item More than one installed {\OpenCL} platform is now allowed (thanks to Aditya Patel).
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Version 1.1.0}
A large number of new features and improvements over the 1.0.5 release are now available:
\begin{itemize}
 \item The completely rewritten {\OpenCL} back-end allows for multiple contexts, multiple devices and even to wrap existing OpenCL resources into ViennaCL objects. A tutorial demonstrates the new functionality. Thanks to Josip Basic for pushing us into that direction.
 \item The tutorials are now named according to their purpose.
 \item The dense matrix type now supports both row-major and column-major
storage.
 \item Dense and sparse matrix types now now be filled using STL-emulated types (\lstinline|std::vector< std::vector<NumericT> >| and \lstinline|std::vector< std::map< unsigned int, NumericT> >|)
 \item BLAS level 3 functionality is now complete. We are very happy with the general out-of-the-box performance of matrix-matrix-products, even though it cannot beat the extremely tuned implementations tailored to certain matrix sizes on a particular device yet.
 \item An automated performance tuning environment allows an optimization of the kernel parameters for the library user's machine. Best parameters can be obtained from a tuning run and stored in a XML file and read at program startup using pugixml.
 \item Two now preconditioners are now included: A Jacobi preconditioner and a row-scaling preconditioner. In contrast to ILUT, they are applied on the OpenCL device directly.
 \item Clean compilation of all examples under Visual Studio 2005 (we recommend newer compilers though...).
 \item Error handling is now carried out using C++ exceptions.
 \item Matrix Market now uses index base 1 per default (thanks to Evan Bollig for reporting that)
 \item Improved performance of norm\_X kernels.
 \item Iterative solver tags now have consistent constructors: First argument is the relative tolerance, second argument is the maximum number of total iterations. Other arguments depend on the respective solver.
 \item A few minor improvements here and there (thanks go to Riccardo Rossi and anonymous sourceforge.net users for reporting the issues)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Version 1.0.x}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.5} 
This is the last 1.0.x release. The main changes are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Added a reader and writer for MatrixMarket files (thanks to Evan Bollig for suggesting that)
 \item Eliminated a bug that caused the upper triangular direct solver to fail on NVIDIA hardware for large matrices (thanks to Andrew Melfi for finding that)
 \item The number of iterations and the final estimated error can now be obtained from iterative solver tags.
 \item Improvements provided by Klaus Schnass are included in the developer converter script (OpenCL kernels to C++ header)
 \item Disabled the use of reference counting for OpenCL handles on Mac OS X (caused seg faults on program exit)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.4} 
The changes in this release are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item All tutorials now work out-of the box with Visual Studio 2008.
 \item Eliminated all {\ViennaCL} related warnings when compiling with Visual Studio 2008.
 \item Better (experimental) support for double precision on ATI GPUs, but no \texttt{norm\_1}, \texttt{norm\_2}, \texttt{norm\_inf} and \texttt{index\_norm\_inf} functions using ATI Stream SDK on GPUs in double precision.
 \item Fixed a bug in GMRES that caused segmentation faults under Windows.
 \item Fixed a bug in \texttt{const\_sparse\_matrix\_adapter} (thanks to Abhinav Golas and Nico Galoppo for almost simultaneous emails on that)
 \item Corrected incorrect return values in the sparse matrix regression test suite (thanks to Klaus Schnass for the hint)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.3} 
The main improvements in this release are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Support for multi-core CPUs with ATI Stream SDK (thanks to Riccardo Rossi, UPC. BARCELONA TECH, for suggesting this)
 \item \lstinline|inner_prod| is now up to a factor of four faster (thanks to Serban Georgescu, ETH, for pointing the poor performance of the old implementation out)
 \item Fixed a bug with \lstinline|plane_rotation| that caused system freezes with ATI GPUs.
 \item Extended the doxygen generated reference documentation 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.2} 
A bug-fix release that resolves some problems with the Visual C++ compiler.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fixed some compilation problems under Visual C++ (version 2005 and 2008).
 \item All tutorials accidentally relied on {\ublas}. Now \texttt{tut1} and \texttt{tut5} can be compiled without {\ublas}
 \item Renamed \texttt{aux/} folder to \texttt{auxiliary/} (caused some problems on windows machines)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.1} 
This is a quite large revision of \texttt{ViennaCL 1.0.0}, but mainly improves things under the hood.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Fixed a bug in lu\_substitute for dense matrices
 \item Changed iterative solver behavior to stop if a certain relative residual is reached
 \item ILU preconditioning is now fully done on the CPU, because this gives best overall performance
 \item All OpenCL handles of {\ViennaCL} types can now be accessed via member function \texttt{handle()}
 \item Improved GPU performance of GMRES by about a factor of two.
 \item Added generic \texttt{norm\_2} function in header file \texttt{norm\_2.hpp}
 \item Wrapper for \texttt{clFlush()} and \texttt{clFinish()} added
 \item Device information can be queried by \texttt{device.info()}
 \item Extended documentation and tutorials
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.0}
First release
